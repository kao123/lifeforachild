= Setup instructions for the Life for a Child Development Environment. =

== Software ==

Download and install:
  # Java JDK 6
  # Tortoise SVN
  # Springsource toolsuite (STS)
  # Apache Tomcat 6
  # MYSQL Server and MYSQL Workbench

Note: Maven and Roo come installed with STS so don't need to be installed separately.

== Maven Setup ==

  # Add the M2_HOME environment variable by opening up the system properties (WinKey + Pause), selecting the "Advanced" tab, and the "Environment Variables" button, then adding the M2_HOME variable in the user variables with the value C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.0.3. Be sure to omit any quotation marks around the path even if it contains spaces. Note: For Maven < 2.0.9, also be sure that the M2_HOME doesn't have a '\' as last character.
  # In the same dialog, add the M2 environment variable in the user variables with the value %M2_HOME%\bin.
  # In the same dialog, update/create the Path environment variable in the user variables and prepend the value %M2% to add Maven available in the command line.
  # In the same dialog, make sure that JAVA_HOME exists in your user variables or in the system variables and it is set to the location of your JDK, e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02 and that %JAVA_HOME%\bin is in your Path environment variable.

== Database Setup ==

  # open command prompt and run the following:
  * cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin
  * mysqld

  # open a new command prompt and run the following:
  * mysqladmin -u root password NEWPASSWORD
  * cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin
  * mysql -u root -p
  -- enter password created above when requested
  * create database life_for_a_child;
  * use life_for_a_child;

  * CREATE USER 'dev'@'localhost'
    IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

  * GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dev2'@'localhost'
   WITH GRANT OPTION; 

  -- make sure you do on separate lines
  * exit;

check you can connect using this new user
mysql -u dev -p
