#summary Design for reporting component.

= Introduction =

This document will outline the design for the reporting component.

= Screen Design =

= Database Design =

A table would be added to the database to store saved reports.

|| *ID* || *name* || *type* || *status* || *timePeriodNum* || *timePeriod* || *fromDate* || *toDate* || *showRecord* || *displayFields* ||
 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 

Each report would have a unique ID. The user could give the report a name. displayFields would be a comma separated list of fields to display in the report based on what was checked in the 'display options' section. The rest of the fields are the settings from the 'report filter' section.

= Questions =

 # Can users see all saved reports? Or only ones they have created?
 # Which fields should always be shown in a report?
 # Which fields should be configurable for a report?
