The following screenshot is a suggested layout for selecting and configuring reports.

The 'Saved Reports' dropdown contains a list of all saved reports. If a saved report is selected the fields on the screen will be updated as they were configured for the original report.

There are three buttons:
 # Show - shows the selected or configured report
 # Save - allows the report configuration to be saved, prompting the user for a name for the report.
 # Delete - allows a saved report to be deleted.

The report filter fields are defined as:
 * Report Type - Mandatory. Either Patient or Record
 * Status - Optional. If none selected will get all records. Options to get updated or not updated records.
 * Time period - Optional. Numeric value in the first field, months or years to be selected in the second field. i.e. 6 months
 * Date Range - Optional. A specific date range can be searched.
 * Show - Optional. what records to show. Options include: first, last and all.

= Database Design =

A table would be added to the database to store saved reports.

|| *ID* || *name* || *type* || *status* || *timePeriodNum* || *timePeriod* || *fromDate* || *toDate* || *showRecord* || *displayFields* ||
 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||

Each report would have a unique ID. The user could give the report a name. displayFields would be a comma separated list of fields to display in the report based on what was checked in the 'display options' section. The rest of the fields are the settings from the 'report filter' section.

= Questions =

 # Can users see all saved reports? Or only ones they have created?
 # Which fields should always be shown in a report?
 # Which fields should be configurable for a report?
 # Who should be able to delete saved reports?
